  # By default, ntpsec looks for a special configuration file dynamically
  # generated by the DHCP client, based on the contents of the real
  # configuration file.  That means stale configuration is still in use after a
  # deployment, even after restarting the ntpsec service is restarted, until
  # "the next DHCP event".  The client also just doesn't need NTP server
  # information from DHCP; it is being supplied by this role.
